# Vibe-Coding
This repository is a personal sandbox for fast, experimental, and sometimes messy coding projects.

The goal is exploration, learning, and creative freedom rather than production-ready code.

## What you'll find here
- Small Python experiments
- Generative graphics and visual tests
- NLP mini-projects
- Automation scripts
- Random ideas and quick prototypes

Each subfolder represents a small, self-contained experiment.

## Philosophy
- No over-engineering
- Speed over perfection
- Ideas over polish

Code quality may vary on purpose.

## Collaboration
Feedback, ideas, and discussions are welcome.
If something inspires you, feel free to fork it or open an issue.

## Disclaimer
This repository is not intended for direct production use.
